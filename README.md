## Operating System Simulator

Four part project meant to simulate a simple Operating System by reading configuration files and meta data files and then using them to
run mock programs.

PA01 - Read config and meta data files and store them in data structures for future use

PA02 - Single threaded OS simulator that only uses First Come First Serve - Non-preemptive (FCFS-N)  scheduling and uses POSIX threads to handle
I/O operations.

PA03 - Single threaded OS simulator that can handle FCFS-N and Shortest Job First - Non-preemptive (SJF-N) scheduling, uses POSIX 
threads to handle I/O operations, and can allocate and access memory.

PA04 - In progress

# How to use

make the file using the sim##_mf and then run the simulator passing in a configuration file as the first argument.
